# üêú Antherium

Welcome to Antherium, an idle strategy game where you manage and grow a burgeoning ant colony.

## How to Play

The goal of Antherium is to expand your anthill from a humble colony into a thriving empire.

### Core Mechanics

*   **Population Growth:** Your queen will automatically lay eggs over time. These eggs hatch into larvae, which then evolve into worker ants. Your population capacity is determined by the number and level of your Nurseries.
*   **Resources:** There are four primary resources: **Food**, **Dirt**, **Wood**, and **Leaves**. You'll need these for almost everything.
*   **Expeditions:** To gather resources, you must send your idle ants on expeditions. Select a resource type and your ants will venture out, returning with rewards after a set amount of time.
*   **Construction:** Use your resources to build new chambers in your anthill. Each chamber provides a unique benefit, such as increasing population capacity (Nursery) or unlocking new game systems (Laboratory).
*   **Technology:** Once you build a Laboratory, you can begin researching new technologies. Research costs resources and time, but unlocks powerful new abilities, chambers, and bonuses.

### Keyboard Shortcuts

*   **S:** Manually save the game.
*   **F:** Send 1 ant on a Food expedition.
*   **W:** Send 1 ant on a Wood expedition.
*   **D:** Send 1 ant on a Dirt expedition.
*   **L:** Send 1 ant on a Leaves expedition.

*   **Configurable Settings:** Adjust the game speed and auto-save interval to your liking via the settings panel.
*   **Keyboard Shortcuts:** Use keyboard shortcuts for common actions to improve your workflow.
*   **Persistent State:** The game automatically saves your progress in your browser's `localStorage` and loads it when you return.
